# Django + Docker Cookiecutter Template

A pragmatic Django template with Docker-first development, split settings, and sensible defaults.  
Generate a production-ready baseline in minutes â€” then customize.

- The project is ready to run inside the docker exatcly after the cookiecutter generation.

- Database name is attached to project_slug.

- .env file is generated automatically based on .env.example.

- DJANGO_SECRET_KEY and POSTGRES_PASSWORD are generated automatically after the template generation (see hooks/post_gen_project.py).

- **Don't forget to change DB password if you're not OK with the generated one.**

---

## âœ¨ What this template gives you

- **Django 5.x** project scaffolded via Cookiecutter
- **Dockerized development** (Django + PostgreSQL) with persistent volumes
- **Clean settings layout**: `config/settings/{base,dev,prod}.py`
- **12-factor friendly**: environment variables via `.env`
- **Makefile helpers** for common tasks
- **CI/CD-ready** (GitHub Actions friendly layout)

> You work on code locally (hot-reload). DB lives in Docker. No local Postgres install required.
